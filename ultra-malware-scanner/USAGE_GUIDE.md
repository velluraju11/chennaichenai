# Complete Reverse Engineering Analyzer

A comprehensive tool for reverse engineering analysis with automated reporting and AI-powered HTML generation.

## Features

- **Automated File Analysis**: Runs multiple reverse engineering tools sequentially
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed JSON and HTML reports
- **Security Analysis**: Identifies potential security risks and vulnerabilities
- **AI-Powered Reports**: Uses Gemini API to create professional HTML reports
- **Impact Analysis**: Provides recreation steps and security recommendations

## Installation

1. **Setup the environment:**
   ```bash
   python setup_analyzer.py
   ```

2. **Install system tools (if missing):**
   - **Ubuntu/Debian:**
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install binutils binwalk file
     ```
   - **CentOS/RHEL:**
     ```bash
     sudo yum install binutils binwalk file
     ```
   - **macOS:**
     ```bash
     brew install binutils binwalk file
     ```

## Usage

### Basic Analysis (JSON report only)
```bash
python complete_reverse_analyzer.py /path/to/target/file
```

### With Gemini API (JSON + HTML reports)
```bash
python complete_reverse_analyzer.py /path/to/target/file --gemini-key YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
```

### Custom output directory
```bash
python complete_reverse_analyzer.py /path/to/target/file --output-dir custom_reports
```

## Getting Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Use the key with `--gemini-key` parameter

## Analysis Tools Included

1. **strings** - Extract readable strings from binary files
2. **hexdump** - Display file content in hexadecimal format
3. **file** - Determine file type and format
4. **binwalk** - Analyze and extract firmware images
5. **objdump** - Display object file information
6. **readelf** - Display ELF file information

## Report Contents

### JSON Report
- File metadata (hashes, size, timestamps)
- Analysis results from all tools
- Security findings and risk assessment
- Recommendations and mitigation strategies

### HTML Report (with Gemini API)
- Executive summary
- Visual analysis results
- Security findings with severity levels
- Impact analysis
- Recreation steps
- Detailed recommendations
- Professional formatting with CSS

## Security Features

- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies potential security vulnerabilities
- **Sensitive Data Detection**: Finds hardcoded secrets, passwords, keys
- **File Type Analysis**: Assesses risks based on file characteristics
- **Mitigation Recommendations**: Provides actionable security advice

## Example Output Structure

```
reports/
├── complete_analysis_sample_20250809_161758.json
└── complete_analysis_sample_20250809_161758.html

test_analysis/
└── sample_file (copy of analyzed file)
```

## Command Line Options

- `file_path` - Path to the file to analyze (required)
- `--gemini-key` - Gemini API key for HTML report generation
- `--output-dir` - Custom output directory for reports (default: reports)

## Troubleshooting

1. **Missing tools error**: Install required system tools using package manager
2. **Permission denied**: Ensure you have read access to the target file
3. **Gemini API error**: Check your API key and internet connection
4. **Large file timeout**: Some tools may timeout on very large files

## Security Considerations

- Always analyze unknown files in isolated environments
- The tool creates copies of analyzed files in the test folder
- Review security findings carefully before taking action
- Use the recommendations as guidance, not absolute rules
